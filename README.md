# Lingva Master
Lingva Master is a personal vocabulary memorization application developed using Python and the DeepSeek R1 model. The words the user wants to memorize are stored in a .txt file, and words can be added or removed directly from the application. To maintain a daily streak and earn extra points, users must complete a minimum of 100-word tests each day. Every correct answer and the progress of the daily streak contribute to accumulating points.
